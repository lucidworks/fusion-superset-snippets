# fusion-superset-snippets (Currently on Part 1 but this README and Repo will evolve as we dive further into the integration)
 
Here is a repo storing all the snippets you can use to verify if your configurations are correct. The following highlights what each file is and how it is useful.

1. hive-site.xml -> configuration file for Apache Hive within Fusion.
2. sql-log4j.xml -> configuration file for the SQL logger within Fusion. 
3. fusion.properties -> a snippet of the main Fusion configuration file so that you can compare it to yours.
